# SecureNet Protocol (SNP) Blueprint

## Overview
The SecureNet Protocol (SNP) is designed to provide secure communication between IIoT devices. This document outlines the architecture, design principles, and technical details of the protocol.

## Architecture
### Protocol Layers
- **Application Layer**: Handles data formatting and protocol-specific operations.
- **Security Layer**: Implements encryption and authentication mechanisms (e.g., TLS with AES-256).
- **Transport Layer**: Manages reliable data transmission and session management.

## Design Decisions
- **Encryption**: SNP uses TLS with AES-256 to ensure end-to-end encryption of data.
- **Authentication**: Digital certificates are used for mutual authentication between devices.
- **Data Integrity**: SHA-256 hashing is employed to verify the integrity of transmitted data.

## Implementation Details
- **Packet Structure**: Each SNP packet consists of a header, payload, and footer. The header contains metadata, the payload carries the encrypted data, and the footer includes integrity checks.
- **Communication Flow**:
  1. **Handshake**: Devices exchange certificates and establish a secure session.
  2. **Data Exchange**: Encrypted data packets are transmitted between devices.
  3. **Session Termination**: The secure session is gracefully terminated, ensuring no data leakage.

## Usage Example
- **Server Setup**: Steps to deploy the SNP server.
- **Client Setup**: Steps to connect a client to the SNP server.
- **Code Samples**: Example Python code for server and client implementations.

## Future Work
- **Feature Enhancements**: Potential improvements to SNP, such as support for additional encryption algorithms or integration with existing IIoT frameworks.
- **Performance Optimization**: Plans to reduce latency and improve throughput in high-traffic environments.

## Conclusion
The SecureNet Protocol (SNP) provides a robust framework for secure IIoT communication, addressing key challenges such as encryption, authentication, and data integrity.
