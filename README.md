Blueprint - SecureNet Protocol (SNP) for IIoT environments in smart grids, ensuring secure communication via TLS
SecureNet Protocol (SNP)
Overview
SecureNet Protocol (SNP) is a custom protocol designed to ensure secure communication between Internet of Things (IoT) devices, with a particular focus on Industrial IoT (IIoT) environments. SNP provides robust encryption, mutual authentication, and data integrity checks to protect sensitive information as it moves across networks.

Features
End-to-End Encryption: Uses AES-256 encryption within TLS to ensure data confidentiality.
Mutual Authentication: Utilizes digital certificates to authenticate both clients and servers, preventing unauthorized access.
Data Integrity: Employs SHA-256 hashing to ensure that data is not tampered with during transmission.
Low-Latency Communication: Optimized for IIoT environments where low latency is critical.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
To use the SecureNet Protocol, you’ll need:

Python 3.x installed on your system.
OpenSSL for generating SSL certificates.
A working GNS3 environment (if you wish to simulate the network).
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Dewmi123W/SecureNet-Protocol.git
cd SecureNet-Protocol
Set Up the Environment:

Install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Generate SSL Certificates:

Use OpenSSL to generate the necessary SSL certificates for server and client authentication:

bash
Copy code
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout server.key -out server.crt -days 365 -nodes
Run the Protocol:

Start the server on one device:

bash
Copy code
python3 src/snp.py server
Start the client on another device:

bash
Copy code
python3 src/snp.py client <server_ip_address>
Usage
Server: Listens on a specified port and establishes a secure communication channel with the client.
Client: Connects to the server, authenticates, and exchanges encrypted data.
Example usage:

bash
Copy code
# Start the server
python3 src/snp.py server

# Start the client and connect to the server
python3 src/snp.py client 192.168.1.2
